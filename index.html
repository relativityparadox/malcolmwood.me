      Hi, I'm Malcolm. This is a personal site I'm currently building, and it's going to be super cool.<br>
      The website is a work in progress â€” I'm hoping it will go live at its own domain in early September. I haven't yet registered the domain, so in order to ensure against poaching, I won't share it yet.<br>
