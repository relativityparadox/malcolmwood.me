          <h2>Modern elegance.</h2>
          <div class="text">I designed this site to embody a refined, elegant aethstetic — no surface is left
            unfinished, but color, motion, and shadow are used with intention. The goal is to use just enough movement
            and emphasis to make the space feel alive, but not to distract or make elements confusing; for example, the
            navbar expands on hover, but the links stay anchored.</div>
          <div class="text">I take a lot of inspiration from Rauno Freiberg — a professional web designer from Estonia —
            and his playful postmodern interfaces. His <a href="https://interfaces.rauno.me" target="_blank">web design
              guidelines</a> are a useful tool for improving interactivity, motion, and accessibility.</div>

            by a secure, robust developer platform. I believe in respect for privacy and data security on the web, and I
            strive to build my website with these principles in mind.</div>
